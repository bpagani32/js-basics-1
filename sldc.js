// Plannning :when the project plan is developed that identifies, prioritizes, and assigns the tasks and resources required to build the structure for a project.

// Analysis of Requirements:During this software development lifecycle phase, the specialists meticulously collect precise requirements from the customer to present a solution fine-tuned to their needs. Any unclarities must be elucidated in this stage only.

// Design:describes how each and every feature in the product should work. It’s also in this phase when the database specification is developed to decide on data management and storage for future processing, retrieval, or evaluation.

// Implementation:includes user notification, user training, installation of hardware, installation of software onto production computers, and integration of the system into daily work processes. 

// Testing & Integration:All software and hardware configuration item components have been constructed and successfully tested.All integration plans are prepared. The Transition Plan for existing data and processes that will be reused is complete.

// Maintain:Maintenance of software can include software upgrades, repairs, and fixes of the software if it breaks. Software applications often need to be upgraded or integrated with new systems the customer deploys.
